## About me
<h1>In this data-driven realm, where terabytes flow,</h1>
<p>A purpose emerges, a dream starts to grow.<br>
To create and serve, something new, unseen,<br>
A gift to the world, a vision so keen.</p>

<p>At first, app development held my fascination's sway,<br>
With basic skills, I began my way.<br>
But amidst the wonders, a hero took the lead,<br>
IRON MAN, the inspiration that planted the seed.</p>

<p>Curiosity awakened, wonders I've sought,<br>
How devices recognize, how robots are taught.<br>
AI, the realm where my true passion lies,<br>
Data science embraced, it was no surprise.</p>

<p>Deep learning, a realm of untold might,<br>
Machine learning's dance, a captivating sight.<br>
Computer vision, gazing into the soul,<br>
And NLP, where words and meaning intertwine, my goal.</p>

<p>In Python's embrace, I've found my way,<br>
Through BCA's journey, I embark today.<br>
A student, a seeker, in the first semester's phase,<br>
With stars in my eyes and dreams ablaze.</p>

<p>A team player, eager to lend a hand,<br>
To help others rise, to understand.<br>
In this ever-evolving, vast AI domain,<br>
Together, we'll chart the path, together, we'll gain.</p>

<p>So let the data flow, let the algorithms soar,<br>
In this world of AI, together we'll explore.<br>
With passion as our compass, and Python as our art,<br>
We'll craft the future, where dreams find their start.</p>

Deep learning, a realm of untold might,
Machine learning's dance, a captivating sight.
Computer vision, gazing into the soul,
And NLP, where words and meaning intertwine, my goal.

In Python's embrace, I've found my way,
Through BCA's journey, I embark today.
A student, a seeker, in the first semester's phase,
With stars in my eyes and dreams ablaze.

A team player, eager to lend a hand,
To help others rise, to understand.
In this ever-evolving, vast AI domain,
